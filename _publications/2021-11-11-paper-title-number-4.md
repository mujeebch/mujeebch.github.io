excerpt: 'Adversarial learning is used to test the robustness of machine learning algorithms under attack and create attacks that deceive the anomaly detection methods in Industrial Control System (ICS). Given that security assessment of an ICS demands that an exhaustive set of possible attack patterns is studied, in this work, we propose an association rule mining-based attack generation technique. The technique has been implemented using data from a Secure Water Treatment plant. The proposed technique was able to generate more than 110,000 attack patterns constituting a vast majority of new attack vectors which were not seen before. Automatically generated attacks improve our understanding of the potential attacks and enable the design of robust attack detection techniques.'

The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is witnessing widespread deployments for emerging applications in diverse domains such as remote sensing, smart homes, and industry 4.0. There is also a growing need to secure such deployments against malicious IoT devices to sustain normal network operations. Since the IoT deployments encompass geographically distributed nodes, blockchain technology, which inherently offers distributed trust in such scenarios, is gaining popularity in providing a secure and trusted IoT deployment. In this paper, we present a use case in which an IoT deployment is retrofitted with a blockchain. The use of blockchain prevents malicious nodes from falsifying information about their energy levels. We first present attack scenarios where IoT nodes can spoof energy while joining or being a part of the network. We then build a defense strategy and evaluate its performance under various attack scenarios. Our results indicate that the IoT deployment is robust under the proposed defense strategy which can detect if a node is spoofing its energy levels over 75% of the time.
